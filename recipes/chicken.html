        <h5> Delicious Chicken: Straight from the Fridge</h5>

        <p> Chicken is quite good for you. Very Delicious. That's why I keep offering it <br>
        to my grandson. If Ethan hopes to become a strong working man, he needs to eat! <br>
        I hope you understand the importance of a healthy diet</p>
        <p> In this recipe I will show you how to always have chicken on hand, in your fridge<br>
        so that if anyone is hungry, you have just open the fridge, and hey presto! Chicken!!!! <br>
        Its almost as good as the nut hack I have. You know, keep a packet of nuts in your <br>
        purse so that you can break them out after the service ends for Yom Kippur. That <br>
        way you can break your fast and not wait on your crazy extended family to sit at the table
        </p>
