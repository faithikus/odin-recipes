        <h5>A Peanut Butter Sandwhich</h5>
        <h6>Just the way Ethan likes it</h6>

        <p>Have you ever needed to feed a family member, but you down really want <br>
        to break out the frying pan? Look no further. In this recipe I will take you <br>
        through doing the bare minumum to put food on the table. The good news is that <br>
        kids like anything with sugar, and this has <strong>a lot</strong> of sugar!!</p>

        <p>Your grandson will love it. He will grow into an amazing boy. Private schools <br>
        will offer him free admission. Even an idiot could make this sandwhich! An added <br>
        bonus is that if you add enough peanut butter it will glue his jaw shut, so <br>
        that he doesn't talk over your favorite TV show.</p>
